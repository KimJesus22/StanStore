# Group Order Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated:** February 19, 2026

Welcome to **StanStore**. Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before participating in any Group Order (GO). By placing an order, you agree to be bound by these terms.

## 1. Nature of Service
**StanStore acts solely as an intermediary and facilitator** for the joint importation of merchandise. We organize the group purchase to optimize shipping costs and manage the logistics from the country of origin to your destination.

*   We are **not** the manufacturers of the products.
*   We facilitate the purchase on behalf of the group participants from authorized suppliers or official stores.

## 2. Payment Structure
To manage international logistics effectively, payments are divided into three stages. You understand and agree that the initial price paid is not the final total cost.

### 1st Payment: Product Cost
*   Covers the cost of the merchandise itself.
*   Includes domestic shipping from the supplier to our warehouse in the country of origin (e.g., Korea, Japan, USA).
*   Includes facilitator fees.

### 2nd Payment: International Shipping (EMS/DHL)
*   Calculated once all items from the Group Order arrive at our consolidation warehouse.
*   The total shipping cost is divided among participants based on the weight/volume of their items.
*   You will be notified via email when this payment is due.

### 3rd Payment: Customs & Local Shipping
*   **Customs/Taxes:** Import duties and taxes assessed by local customs authorities upon arrival in your country.
*   **Local Shipping:** The cost to ship the item from our local distribution center to your provided address.
*   This amount is variable and must be paid before the final delivery of your goods.

## 3. Cancellation and Refund Policy
Due to the nature of Group Orders, **ALL SALES ARE FINAL**.

*   **No Cancellations:** Once the Group Order period closes and funds have been remitted to the foreign supplier, **no cancellations or refunds will be accepted under any circumstances.**
*   **Exceptions:** A full refund will only be issued if the official supplier or artist cancels the production or release of the item, or if the item goes out of stock before we can secure it.
*   By placing an order, you acknowledge that you cannot withdraw your participation once the order is processed.

## 4. Wait Times and Delays
International Group Orders involve complex logistics.

*   **Estimated Times:** Any dates provided are **estimates only** and are not guaranteed.
*   **External Factors:** Delays may occur due to production delays by the label/artist, weather conditions, flight shortages, or customs processing/inspections.
*   **Customs Clearance:** We have no control over how long customs authorities hold a package for inspection.
*   **Acknowledgment:** By joining a Group Order, you agree to wait the necessary time for the products to arrive safely. Impatience or delays are not valid grounds for cancellation.

## 5. Payment Deadlines and Abandoned Merchandise ("Ghosting")
To ensure the smooth operation of Group Orders for all participants, strict payment deadlines apply.

*   **Deadlines:** You have a maximum of **14 calendar days** to complete Payment 2 (International Shipping) or Payment 3 (Customs/Local) from the date the notification is sent via email.
*   **Abandonment:** If payment is not received within this timeframe and no communication is made, your merchandise will be considered **abandoned**.
*   **Forfeiture:** Abandoned items become the property of the Group Order Manager (StanStore) and may be resold to cover logistics and storage costs. **You will forfeit your claim to the Release/Item and the initial Payment 1 will NOT be refunded.**
